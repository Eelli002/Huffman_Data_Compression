## Phase I
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you?
  > File compression is an essential aspect of good data managment. It also falls outside of the realm of familiarity for many of our groups memebers. This means its implementaion will encourage collaboration and learning, leaning on the Scrum SDLC's strengths to ensure team synergy. 

 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
   > This project will be implemented using the C++ and Python3 programming languages. It will use the Huffman Encoding algorithm to compress the file in a lossless manner.

 > * What will be the input/output of your project? What are the features that the project provides?
   > This program will take in a text file from the user's file system and return a compressed version to a chosen location.

 > ## Phase II

GUI: 
 - Check all the GUI elements for size, position, width, length, and acceptance of characters or numbers
 - Check you can execute the intended functionality of the application using the GUI
 - Check Error Messages are displayed correctly

RSA encryption/decryption algorithm:
> * Test that large prime numbers are generated correctly.
> * Test that private and public keys generated by large prime numbers are generated correctly.

Huffman Encoding & Decoding:
> * Test that bits accumulated for binary input of data's huffman tree is the same as bits used for decoding tree.
> * Test that encoding is sending proper 32 bits for int of data's length.
> * Test that data length is the same pre and post compression.
> * Test that compressed file size is smaller than pre-compression file size.

 ## Installation/Usage
 > Run command "./Huffman (file name.txt)" or "./Huffman (file name.bin)" from the terminal
 
 > Input a number to perform actions on the file
 
 > Output file is automatically stored in src directory

 
 ## Testing
 > The google testing suite was used to test all driver and back-end code. In order to have access to test each function indiviually, the access modifications of the classes had to be set to public. In a live environment this would not be the case and the program would only have access to the Encoding and Decoding functions plus all other accessable functions in the encryption features.
