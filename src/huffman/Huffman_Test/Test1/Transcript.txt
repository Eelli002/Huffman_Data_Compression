now we've been looking at the elbow escape in considerable detail out of side control it's time for us to switch our emphasis now to a new form of escape. This is the knee escape. This involves me getting up to my knees underneath my opponent's body weight and as a result typically we get into a single leg situation where we can either look for reversals or we can sit back to guard position. Let's look first at the movement just solo just me by myself and we're going to look at the idea of what's required to mechanically get under uh get up underneath someone's body weight. Remember this is a bit of a challenge you've got a 250 pound man on top of you you've got to get underneath his body weight, move underneath, and get up and put them down that's quite a tall order so we're going to need some technique to do that. So i have an imaginary opponent out to my right hand side from here everything starts in these cases with getting an underhook on my training partner don't worry i'll talk more about that shortly from the under hook situation with my training partner we're going to pull our elbow back in towards our own ribcage just like so. I'm going to create a top leg and a bottom leg and from here we're going to scissor our legs and we're going to focus on getting a hold of our training partner's leg and coming up into a situation where i can lock a single leg just like so. Okay and from here we're in a position where we can put them down or sit back to the safety of guard position. So the whole idea is to create a situation much as we did before where i have a top leg and a bottom leg then i just put my hips on the ground i use the underhook to create a situation where one arm is reaching and one arm is retracting so i have an arm going forward and an elbow going backwards just like so and then from here i scissor my legs we get a hold of our training partner's leg and everything now is about getting up to our base and latching onto his leg. Now the way i do this is a little bit different from most i encourage my students to grab one-handed on their opponent's leg i know i just demonstrate it with locked hands that's the conventional method but I'm not a big advocate of locked hands on single legs down on the mat standing position i am a big advocate of locked hands but not so much down on the floor let's have a look at this with matthias across our side. From here we're going to start with an underhook in place okay because i have an underhook it's relatively simple for us to move our training partner's body weight. Okay i'm going to start as we always do with an asymmetrical bridge and a movement that gets my opponent's head moving like so from here i'm going to put one hand around my training partner's leg and i'm going to snake my arm around the knee just like so my second elbow comes back to my own body and we're going to hold on in this position from here i'm going to take my two legs and scissor them one over the other and as a result i can quickly come up into position where we've got a control over our training partner's leg. I've got a base of support with my second hand i have the potential to lock my hands if necessary but generally from the situation i favor open hands from here if necessary i can switch to a double leg
i can come around the corner with single legs if my opponent puts on a wisdom there's various kinds of ways that i can
act in situations like this to take my training partners back and what have you um
let's start off with considerations of why do i favor holding with one hand
okay i'll demonstrate it by myself first too often i see people get into situations like this and they lock their
hands way too early this is a disaster because now i've extended my bottom are
remember to get up i need a bottom a bottom leg a top leg and i need a top
arm and a bottom arm the top arm is my reaching arm and it extends
the bottom arm is my contracting arm and its responsibility is bringing the elbow in the further my elbow is away the more
difficult it is for me to get up so our whole thing is to pull this elbow in
then i reach with the second one i hold the leg one-handed and then it's so easy for us to come up into a position where
we're up on our base so once again we're going to start off with the
underhook in place everything begins with moving his body weight and getting our head
inside his cross face now from here if i go in and i catch a hold of my training partner's leg
there's my top leg there's my bottom leg and now in one motion we just start that signaling action that takes us up into a
position where we're in on our trini partner's leg now from here how i go to react is largely bound up with his
reaction does he have a wizard does he not have a wizard am i able to access the second leg or does he put the leg up
what should i be looking to do we are largely bound up with his reaction a lot of the times we're looking to get our
knee behind his ankle and work from situations like this
but however we choose it it's very very important that we focus on this one-handed grip so often i see
sad things like this happen people do a good job of getting the underhook
they do a good job of turning onto their side but they lock their hands too early if you raise your left hand with that
left hand you'll see my hands are locked too early here so as matthias puts on a
whizzer and sprawls i come up underneath his body weight and i physically
cannot get up and i'm stuck underneath if i had the confidence lock tonight
if i had the confidence to pull my elbow back my tax put all your weight on me matteo says all his weight on it means
nothing i can easily come up to my base and then from here we start that action of turning around behind our training
partner and getting everything into a winning situation okay i'm going to spend you know a lot of
time on these knee escapes coming up to the single leg situation they're a very
very important addition to your side control escapes i put them right up there with the elbow escape in terms of
importance i want to talk to you about a very
important topic for completing a knee escape and this is the idea of beating a
cross face remember the one thing that will stop you tuning into your opponent even if you do have an underhook is your
opponent's cross-face shoulder if he's got a strong authoritative cross face you won't be able to turn into him and
you won't be able to get up to your knees so it's absolutely critical that you have the skill of beating the cross
face once you've got the underhook the good news is it's pretty damn easy if you know what you're doing
so my opponent has across my side i've gotten the underhook but mate still has
a strong cross face as he goes it doesn't matter whether his hands are locked would look it locked for now
or open if he puts cross-face pressure on i cannot turn into a cross face you hear
me struggling because this is going on the good news is you've got an underhook okay so it's my test goes to apply its
pressure i'm going to take my two feet and we're going to use that underhook to get our head to our training
partner's chest my goal is to get my forehead to matthias's sternum that's what we're
looking for that's the goal of my head position okay matthias
always has his goal as a shoulder inside my jaw but once i have the underhook in place
it's relatively easy for me to bridge and shoot my arm
so that my head goes right into the sternum now when a matthias goes to apply
cross-face there's just nothing to work with and as a result it's very easy for me to
come in and secure my training partner's leg one-handed as we always prefer
once we get that one-handed grip it's all about my ability to turn on to my side as he goes to apply his wizard we
come up into the one-handed situation just like so now we're in a good position we'll be
looking at a whole bunch of ways to work from here to either put our opponent down or get towards his back
that's the simple way we go to beat the cross face in these situations one more time i've managed to work my way into an
underhook no matter how much pressure my opponent puts in on that cross face
we can always get our head into the sternum by that bridging method the key element is once again the idea of hip
extension now instead of using a bicep crossbass we're using the underhook the whole key
is this lift and drive so that my whole body comes up onto my shoulder the ball
of my foot and the other ball of my foot my arm reaches i have an extending arm
and a contracting arm i seize my training partner and from here i put my hips on the floor and as my result we
can quickly come up into the single leg situation one more time for another angle
there's my underhook my opponent has his cross face now from here we start that bridging action
and my head goes into the sternum from this position i can't have my arms
locked out extended like so so i always want my elbow back towards myself
there's that scissoring effect which puts me up into a position where i can turn in on my training partner and
go to work
now let's move on to the next aspect of the knee escape series
you've see you've heard me say it no knee escape is going to occur until i get an underhoof
now an underhook is a desirable thing for me to have as the athlete in the bottom position
your opponent also is interested in securing the underhook when he's on top so there's going to be a battle who gets
the underhook i want it he wants it it's impossible for me to hit these knee
escapes without the underhook the question now is how are you going to get an underhook on a guy who doesn't want you to get an underhook he's fighting
for his underhook i'm fighting for mine how am i gonna get it against this resistance let's have a look at that question right
now the easiest way to get into underhooks is to begin
with a forearm reverse cross face just like so okay it's not an easy thing just
to dig in on an underhook especially with a ghee on under normal circumstances typically he will leave no
space between his armpit and your chest it's very hard to dig in things get even
more difficult when my opponent goes ear to ear like so and now not only can i
not dig in it's actually dangerous for me to start reaching and i can get wrist locked in this position i can also get
american lock all kinds of bad things can happen so how am i going to get into an
underhook on a resisting person well typically when things first start off when i first feel someone go into a pin
i always like to take my left hand to my opponent's left shoulder just like so okay
as he goes to nestle into a powerful pen and get ear to ear on me it's quite difficult for
him to get the ear to ear position if my opponent starts off ear to ear
this can be a real problem okay so even as someone gets into a side pin i just
put my left hand on their left shoulder now when they go ear to ear it's quite difficult for them to achieve
from this position as he goes to apply pressure we're going to start with an action of moving his head
just like so i'm going to put my forehead inside his cross face
so my head position goes just inside when he goes to apply a cross face now it's impossible the only way someone can
apply a cross face is to apply it to my jaw when i put my forehead inside the bicep that
becomes all but impossible and now it's safe for me to pummel my arm in as
he will probably go to flatten me out at this point but it doesn't matter because i've got my underhook in place once the
underhooks in it's hard for him to regain it for himself now from here as always we start that same action
of turning inside our opponent now scissor and we come up into our favorite
taking position from underneath with that single leg in place once again
angle [Music]
i always like from the beginning to get my left hand to my opponent's left shoulder or vice versa
and as a result when he goes to get ear to ear positioning to prevent me getting under hooks it's very very difficult
now from here we start that strong bridging action that moves his head
once i can move his head i've opened up a huge space to feed my hand in as an underhook
and from here i go in and i score my training partner's calf muscle now from here i stitch on my legs and we end up
in on our shiny partner's legs ready to play let's have a look at it from another angle so you can see exactly what i'm
trying to do in this situation in order for me to get to an underhook situation i have to maximize the
distance between matthias's armpit and my chest because that's the space to
which my underhook will go matthias has the exact opposite goal he wants to minimize that space by locking
in here and putting his ear to my ear and now he's minimized the space successfully
however if i had my left hand on his left shoulder and he goes to minimize that
space i can always open it up and did you see what happened there's now a mountain of space between
his armpit and my shoulder and as a result i can drive a truck through that kind of space i put my head on the
inside and my hand pummels through and around okay
as my opponent goes to put weight on me now it doesn't matter you've got the underhook in place and now
it's a simple matter of being this cross face we saw how to do that in an earlier segment now we scissor
and we're in a good position now to line up with our training partner and get it to our offense okay
this is an excellent way to score under hooks on a resisting opponent
now i know what you're thinking what if you can't get your hand to the shoulder what if you just shut out how
you're gonna get underhook now okay um let's look at that right now
okay we've got a skilled opponent on top and he did a good job of stopping us from
getting our hand here to this desirable position okay so we're stuck out here in the cold what are we going to do now to
get an underhook well you could probably guess from what we said earlier we're going to use the bicep cross face from
this position we're going to start that action of moving my trini partner's head just like so now i'm going to take
my second hand and as we move away from my opponent he comes back up on top i'm going to put my second hand in here
inside his shoulder now i can use my hands in unison to lock
just inside his shoulder like so as he tries to put weight on me we just use a simple bumping action
to use the strength of both hands and we can pull in and get our underhook in place
now from here we shift our legs and once again we find ourselves in the perfect position to
start putting weight on our training partner and coming around the corner now
some other common tactics for getting into underhooks
again we have an opponent working in this position very often our opponent will have his
hands locked and his head and very very close and this will make it extremely difficult to
get the underhook in place bear in mind however that as my opponent shuts out my left arm he often opens up
space for my right knee and i come in just like so once i get the knee in
we're halfway towards an elbow escape and from here it's not a difficult thing for us to stand over our training
partner's calf muscle and start to move my head away from him as i move my head away from him my
second hand can come inside and take the inside position then i bring my elbow over the top as he
goes to correct his body this is the perfect time for us to get in underneath our feeling partner and start scissoring
and coming up into our training partner's legs and from here we can come around the corner and start scoring
reversals out of this position these are some common means by which i like to
score underhooks on my opponent and get up into our nearest games
now i want to make an important point about anchoring ourselves to our opponent as
we come up from a knee escape the anchoring point is your opponent's leg essentially what you're doing is
you're coming up with an underhook and you're scoring a single leg that's really what you're doing from the single leg situation you're
using his leg as an anchor to pull yourself up to your knees and then reverse your opponent you can do it by
completing a single leg you can take his back you can sit back to god you can do all these things i'll be showing you in
some detail very soon um but it all begins in the same way you've got to anchor yourself to your
opponent's leg the big theme that i'm trying to push on you is that when we're doing single legs down on the mat i
generally prefer holding with one hand snaked around my opponent's calf rather than locking my hands let's have a look
why the tanks is over here underneath okay
if i have a single leg situation with matthias and my hands are locked and we're down
on the mat when my head goes down and positions like this and matthias puts on a wisdom
and starts sprawling i don't care how strong you are when he goes to sprawl you're going to get
stretched out he starts sprawling and your hands are going to break apart as your hip goes down you lose the
ability to hold on to the leg and the hands come apart and he's gone okay
let's contrast that with the idea of holding one-handed okay
ironically one hand turns out to be stronger than two in these situations when i hold with locked hands he's just
fighting the grip of my hands but when i hold with one hand and i snake my wrist with a false grip around my tuning
partner's calf he's not finding the strength in my hands he's finding the extension of my arm it's a very
different thing now when he goes to sprawl i can easily hold on and it's relatively
simple for me to start the action of coming around the corner and putting knees in behind
stepping over his leg etc etc okay it's strange to think that one hand
should turn out to be stronger than two in these circumstances it's not because it's stronger it's just because it's a
different kind of battle when i lock my hands he's fighting against the grip of my hands and of course his legs always
strong in the grip of my hands and they fly apart but when i snake my arm around his calf
muscle he's fighting the reach of my arm and that is a difficult battle for him to win so once again
from a single leg situation what i'm going to advocate is when you come up we snake our arm here around his calf
muscle now when he goes to sprawl i can easily carry his weight
and from here it's not a difficult thing for us to hold on to the leg ironically
if i locked my hands in here and he sprawled i would quickly get extended and put into a weak position with my head down
but when i hold like so and my opponent goes to sprawl i can easily hold on to him and stay on my base and from here
it's not a difficult thing for us to start the various kinds of actions that we favor from this position and start
putting him down towards the floor so when you come out of any knee escape i
strongly advocate coming up with one-handed grips practice the action of snaking your arm
with a bent wrist around your training partner's calf muscle don't grab the knee
don't hook into the knee like so when he sprawls your arm has no extension and you lose
the grip quickly rather sneak around the calf muscle when he goes to sprawl you can easily hold on
to it and it's not a difficult thing under these circumstances to start reaching out with your legs and making
effective costs on your training partner to put people down there's also a vast number of other moves we can do
from there we'll be looking at them shortly but i always favor the idea once i have an underhook in place
that i beat my training partner's cross face to hold one-handed here
now as he sprawls even under his full sprawls rolling even under his full sprawl i can easily
come up to my base and from here it's not a difficult thing for us to start putting people down from
bottom position this method of coming up with one-handed grips is always the one that i favor
just make sure the grip is on the calf muscle with a false grip your arms sneaking around the calf not locked
hands and not grabbing the knee
okay we've looked at the idea of coming up to our knees underneath our
opponent's body weight courtesy of an underhook and the scissoring body movement which gets us up into a single
leg situation we've seen that if we hold a one-handed grip we can get up underneath even a full sprawl get up to
our knees and start climbing around towards our training partner's legs now it's time to actually hit the escape
there's a bunch of different options you got here you can either put your opponent down and
take top position that's a very dramatic form of escape you've gone from bottom position side to
top position that's wonderful another option is to take your opponent's back if he goes into certain kinds of defensive groups who can take
his back that's huge nothing ever beats taking somebody's back that's the best thing that can happen
um and the most conservative option is simply to sit back to guard and that's
not a bad option especially if the guy is significantly heavier and stronger than you uh you were pinned across side
now you came up to your knees you sat back and you got them back and got let's have a look at these three options i'm
going to look first at the idea of putting our opponent down this is always a good option it's nice
to come out of a side pin get up and then authoritatively put the other guy down okay
you were in a losing situation now you're on top and the tide of the battle is turned somewhat so this is always a
desirable option let's look at that first some things about this we're advocating
the idea of a one-handed single leg what should we do once we've got up to a situation he's on two knees
and we're in on the single leg situation okay the primary thing you're gonna be battling against here is a sprawl and
what i'm trying to get you guys away from is the idea of just locking on whereas he sprawls my arms separate and
my head goes down okay as soon as your head goes down to the floor in situations like this and you get
extended you're just in such a mechanically weak position that is very very hard for you
to recover there are some things you can do for me i'm not going to lie to you but it's hard hard work as a general
rule i prefer holding one-handed and using mobility around our opponent to
start putting them down and specifically to start incorporating the strength of our legs what i don't want to do is get
into a battle of my hands against my opponent's legs and hips that's always a losing gambit the other thing i don't
want to do is work from a mechanically disadvantageous posture where my head is down and i'm extended
okay so the big things we're going to incorporate the idea of using our legs to finish to take down not our arms and
the idea of holding body posture in an advantageous way where we can be mechanically strong
one of the reasons why i favor one-handed grips in this situation is that i can use my second hand either my
hand or my elbow as a post so that as matthias goes to sprawl that puts a
limit on how far my head goes down if my elbow collapsed and my head went down he goes to sprawl
i lose control of him immediately because i've gone to a mechanically weak position but as long as my head and chest are up
when he goes to sprawl i can hold his weight comfortably you can hear even as he puts on a full wizard and sprawls my voice is not
changing i'm not working hard here okay but if my head starts to go down he says raw you can hear my voice changing
rapidly so i have to work harder and harder to get anything done so we've come up successfully our opponent
goes into a scroll what's our first option here first option is to start walking my right knee towards his right
knee i slide my knee in just like so i'm going to step my left foot over my training partner's ankle i'm going to
hook onto my training partner's ankle so now i have my legs in on him just like so okay as he goes to apply his wizard
in this position we're going to use this grip to start bringing our head up okay
uh you probably want to hold a better breaking thing now from here look how i start walking a circle on my training
partner i've got his leg hooked he's going to try and stay up as best he can he can put his hands on the floor to do whatever he wants okay and i'm going to
start an action turning corner on my training partner so i'm walking in a
circle it's hard for my opponent to follow those motions okay now i just reach across when i score my
training partner's ankle now from here my hand goes across to the opposite knee and i put my elbow over
his knee just like so when matthias tries to get up from here it's so difficult and he'll always expose either
his back as he just did or if he holds a whizzer he'll expose his side on the
other side so once again from the single leg situation
down on the mat from here i feel my opponent going to scroll we hook in just like so from here
i bring my leg up and i slide my knee towards his knee and i step over the top
and i hook now once we make this hook in position we're going to start the action of
rotating and turning until i can access his ankle now from here i access the knee i go
over the top and we lock for the finish if i see him coming up on his hand look out from the wizard
from here i put my hand on his wrist and i feed the wrist in and drive forward to
put his shoulder on the mat and we end up in an advantageous position once again
we've gotten up to the single leg situation down on the mat as he goes to stall we
hold one-handed i slide my knee towards his knee and i hook into his leg
very often from here you can just put him straight down okay but if there's a struggle
and you're having a hard time putting them down we circle until we can access the ankle
and then from here we start moving that as we reach for the wrist he tries to get up
we just put our hand through there and seize the rest now as a result we're in
in our opponent's pinned shoulder down to the mat this is one excellent way of working out
of a single leg situation and scoring a complete reversal
now let's continue our work with uh coming up to a single leg situation out of a knee escape and putting our
opponent down to the mat the myth we're going to look at now is one of my all-time favorites let's start
with a single leg situation down on the mat we're holding one-handed
what i'm going to do here is i'm going to fight to get my elbow to the floor inside his shin bone
the way i do this is i hold my training partner here at the knee
as my test goes to scroll i'm going to focus in these situations on turning to
face the same direction he is and i'm going to take my knees off the mat
do you see what that just did it forced matthias's other knee to the floor
that's what my goal is if matthias's knee is off the mat it's hard for me to finish takedowns here
he's got a strong swallowing position so what we do is we come with our knees off
the mat and all i do is i just circle and walk and it forces his knee down to
the floor now i take my knee and i put it behind his ankle just like so
he's forced to work with his wizard now from here i grip my training partner
at the knee and i go across to the second ankle and i start pulling that ankle inwards
from this position it's not a difficult thing for us to go over the top and into the same finishing position we
just saw this is one of my absolute favorite ways to work so
from a single leg situation i have my elbow down on the floor matthias goes to sprawl and we hold on
nice and tight from this position look how i take my hand and i come in here
and seize around my training partner's knee now i take my knees off the floor and
tripod as i walk around the corner i easily put my opponent's opposite knee to the mat
i put my knee in behind my training partner's ankle and we're in perfect position now to go across to the second
leg i can pull in here i can even go above the knee and drive
my training partner down and score my reversal whether you go to the ankle or to the knee i leave that up to you it'll
depend on things like the height of your opponent's legs his ability to split his legs far apart things like this but both
the ankle and the knee are both viable targets so switching the angle
from the single leg situation here i have my wrist around his legs he
goes to scroll back and away i keep my body frame look how i move around the corner and i take my elbow down inside
like so i hug onto my training partner's knee and i sweep my legs around the
corner and as a result i can return his opposite knee to the mat i put my knee
inside his ankle from here i go across and i catch either here
or here and then from this position
i start walking him down to the mat now let's look at some common errors
in this position um probably the single most common error i see is this
people do a good job of getting elbow deep and then they just stay static they just stay here they think uh i'm elbow deep
i'm good no you're not good this is not a good position if my opponent puts his right shoulder on the floor he can roll into an uma plata from this position
[Music] and now you're fighting you out of all the platters and potentially triangles as well okay so this is not a position
to stay stack on the contrary once i get my elbow in here it's very
very important that i start that action of moving and getting my ankle in behind like so
and now there's no roll to a normal platform now from this position it'll be pretty easy for us to go across to the second
ankle and start gathering up my opponent's legs okay another very very common mistake and
this one's going to happen to you a thousand times unless you look look out for it don't reach for your opponent's waist
don't reach for the waist so i see this every day
okay here's a mistake that's it's so natural but you've got to avoid it guys do a good job of coming around the
corner like so from here they put their knee in behind
the ankle and they make a tragic mistake they go up to the waist now your opponent has a whizzer on you
and as he applies the wizard [Music] you get returned straight away to the mat okay
if there's one thing you get out of this move get this out of it stay below his buttocks with your arm
don't go above the buttocks to the waist and give him a free wizard when you work below the buttocks and go
for the knee and the ankle you'll put a lot of people down you go above the the hips and buttocks
up to the waist and you'll be the one getting put down so when we lock up here with our training
partner look how i come around the corner and i turn like so
i focus on getting my knee here behind his ankle so it can't roll down on the platter now i capture the knee and look
how my arm reaches across below the buttocks i never come up to the waist
where i give him leverage with his wizard i always stay down here with my shoulder behind where i can access the
ankle or the knee and put him down to the floor okay
let's have a look at all this again from a situation
where i had an underhook on my training partner and i came up it's like so our whole
thing in this situation is to catch a hold of our chinny partner's knee and turn it on the hips and as a result we
can block the ankle then i go across here to the knee across to the second ankle or even across to the second knee
like so and then from this position we put our opponent's hips on the floor
and low and behold we're in a good position to score our reversal
done in this fashion you'll put a lot of people down coming out of bottom side control
now we look at this idea of escaping from side control courtesy of the underhook
and coming up into our opponent's legs into a single leg situation off our knees this in my mind is probably the
second most significant method of escaping out of side control only beaten by the elbow escape in terms of
effectiveness and modern day competition so it's absolutely critical that we'd be very very strong in this method
um it has a bonus too it offers you the opportunity to not only escape from your opponent's pin but to go up and put him
down on his back so you literally completely turn the match around your bottom pin and now you're on top of the
guy so that's a that's a truly noteworthy thing um
there's a bunch of different options that we get when we come up to our knees underneath our opponent the first option
i want you to become strong at is the single leg down the mat and put your opponent down there are other options that we'll be
looking at soon but this single leg option is the first one now there is a problem associated with this you're
coming up underneath his body weight into a situation where he can sprawl heavily upon you
so the big skill that you guys have to develop is the skill of moving under
your opponent's body weight and still being effective it's easy to get intimidated when you come up into a
single leg and you feel a heavy sprawl you get stretched out your arms get extended and you have ah let me just sit
back to god um we'll see later on there are good ways to sit back together nothing wrong with that
but what i'm saying too is you can't be intimidated by the first time you feel
some body weight on top of you you can't stop just because the guy just scrolls on you if we hold our body in mechanically
efficient fashions you can easily continue to a successful completion of a
single leg even against a decent scroll the question is do you know how to hold
your body in an efficient fashion and that's what we're going to cover right now so
we're looking at the idea that we're bottom side control we've managed to get an underhook on our training partner we
know that once we get that under hook we want to work up here by the head we never use our underhook down here by the hips we work up at the head from this
position we start that action of bridging and shooting our head underneath our training partner's chair so he's no
longer chest to chest on top of us from here we come down to our training partner's leg and we take our one-handed
grip that we generally favor my elbow goes inside his knee and then from this position we scissor our legs and we come
up into a single leg situation i initially i want to be perpendicular to my training partner's
body i don't want to be squared up underneath them lined up like so i always want that perpendicular
angle okay now my opponent wants to square up to me and sprawl that's always what he's
looking for okay we'll see how to deal with that later but initially what i want to do is hold one handed and snake
my hand around his calf muscle let's move around this way so i can i can pick this up
so i want to hold one-handed and sneak my hand here so when he goes to sprawl i
can hold on successfully through the extension of my arms okay now we have a bunch of options here i can slide my
knee towards his knee and step over his ankle that was one good option but the one i'm currently looking at is the
option of going through on my training partner elbow deep around my training partner's calf and from here we're in a
position to start to move around behind with our intention to get our knee inside of our training partner's ankle
okay so that's our intention that's our big picture that we're working with here now what i want to do is i want to talk to
you about the proper body mechanics to get up underneath your opponent's resisting body weight and get through to
your opponent's leg and get behind him there's a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this i'll just demonstrate the solo first
okay so often i see people get up to the single leg situation they're in on the leg and
the the first thing is you got to get your knees off the mat okay if i stay on my knees in this position it's just my
hands versus his legs okay i've got to incorporate my legs into the picture so we need to get our knees up off the mat
now the most common error that i see whenever people get their knees off the mat is they have their hips in a
symmetrical position they come up like this that puts no weight on my opponent's
legs and hips what i want to do is come up with my hips asymmetrical
like so and i backstep around the corner a lot of times i even
sweep my legs in an exaggerated fashion where i sweep my legs back all the way like so and i move back with one hip
down and one hip up never with my hips even symmetrical like
so always asymmetrical hips one high one low and
as a result i can put tremendous weight and pressure on my opponent's legs and
hips we'll bring the tails back okay we'll just start in a single leg situation for now we'll start on the
side so the camera can see okay he's got his leg up so i can't switch to a double leg if mateis was
naive and he had two knees on the mat there's no reason from here where i can't just switch to a double they can put them down so matthias is a good uh
good man and keeps his leg away from me like so now he's going to have a strong whizzer
and here like so okay from the single leg situation i take my knees off the mat and look how from here i start that
action of putting one hip up and one hip down just like so this puts tremendous
weight on my training partner's hips and legs the action of walking back and around quickly collapses him and we're
now in a situation where i can easily get my knee behind his ankle and from here make the transition either to the
second knee or to the second ankle and we can walk them down to the mat
this puts tremendous pressure on my training partner's quarter step let's have a look at it again the other angle
so here we are we've gotten in on that single leg situation okay if i stay with my knees on the mat this is a losing
gambit so instead we're going to focus on this idea of turning our hips and taking our
knees off the floor and it puts this grinding pressure on my training partner it makes it so easy to transition in
behind my training partner's ankle and then from here we can get through to the second leg and put that man down
so once again the key element is this idea when we come up off our
knees we never come up symmetrical we always come up asymmetrical and start that action of sweeping around the
corner with asymmetrical hips this is the only way to apply true
grinding pressure on your opponent's thigh and hip to put them down to the mat
now let's talk about hand grips from this position you've got a couple of options here and they're all good
for a situation where you come up into a single leg here typically most people lock their hands
okay in the standard configuration if my left arm is the outside arm my left hand
will be the top hand that's the standard way of working okay but when we go down
on the mat with a single open we want to finish what i'm going to advocate is we switch our hands to this configuration
here i unlock my hands and i just put my hand over hand in this position and i just come up and i just put two hands on
the floor and as a result we can easily get around behind our opponent and get our elbow to the mat and as a result we
can easily get behind the ankle and then start hunting for the second ankle or the second knee and put him down to the
floor so just demonstrate solo here my hands are locked palm to palm i
just turn my hands and go like so i'll come closer to the camera so you can see
here i have a palm to palm grip single leg and i just turn my hands like so you
can have your hands close together but what we don't want is hands locked for this particular variation of the single
leg i just come down hand to hand and then i tripod asymmetrical hips and walk
around and move behind my opponent this greatly facilitates the action of getting around
your opponent's leg to a position behind him so here again we have matthias we've come up successfully from the side
position and we've locked him we've got our hands locked initially and look how just place my hands down okay now i
start an action of extending my arms if my hands are locked in tight and he
sprawls i lose the grip very quickly okay so in this situation i start off look at my
hands come up my elbows come up off the floor and it's that which facilitates this turn around behind my opponent and
as a result we get our knee in behind him we get through to the second leg and we drive him down to the floor so the
action just by myself number ten is initially we're in on the leg
the hands go down the arms extend and look how my chest goes over my own hands
when my chest is over my own hands it's so easy to come up with asymmetrical hips and walk behind our training
partner so here we have a single leg situation down on the mat okay i have my hands
reconfigured just like so i bring my chest as my arms extend i bring my chest
over my hands the further my chest from my hands the easier my tails to sprawl
so we lock up he goes to sprawl the hands go in and my chest goes
forward over the hands i turn my body so we've got asymmetrical hips we start that action
of walking around behind and we hit the double leg from the back so i'll just quickly review this by myself
we're in on a single leg with an imaginary opponent down on the mat we lock up the first thing is we put
hands down on the floor we go away from locked hands to hands on the mat i bring my chest over my own hands so that my
chest and head is high i never want my head down low in a weak mechanical position then from here we go
asymmetrical hips and we walk around behind our opponent get our knee behind the ankle and we either go reverse
double leg or we grip the ankle so one more time we've come up
we're in here on the leg then from here we put the hands down look how we start that action of turning our hips around
the corner i bring my chest over my hands and there's that walk around the corner i place my knee in behind and
from here we access the second leg and put my teeth down
now let's look at a super important detail involved in finishing the single leg uh down the mat when we've come up
from an in the escape from bottom side control you will notice that uh
let me rephrase that i want you to pay particular attention to the knee of the leg that i'm not holding okay if
matthias is on two knees and we're in the single leg situation it's like so
i'm holding on to his left knee initially okay if matthias is naive and
his right knee is on the mat it's just so easy just to reach across to the second leg and just finish right there
with a double leg on the mat okay so matthias is a world championship supply he's not going to be naive like that
he's going to put his other leg up and as a result i can't access the second leg to finish on a double leg so
we need we're going to have to do something uh mechanically interesting here to put him in a position where i can finish with a
double leg where i can get to the second leg because if i can't access the second leg it's going to be hell for me to put
him down it's going to be hard hard work so how are we going to do this what's the trick let's say his legs out wide
we're going to hit that same method that we've been looking at to create pressure on my opponent but i
want you to focus your attention on matthias's right knee as matthias applies his wisdom we're
going to go from locked hands to two hands on the floor we're going to take our knees off the man we're going to put
our weight on our elbow our right elbow in this case we're going to start sweeping around behind our head and
cupping the knee watch matthias's other knee it's forced to the mat by the pressure
of my shoulder into his hip he has no choice but to put his knee on
the mat and once the knee touches the mat it's so easy for me to access the ankle
or the knee and put him down okay this is how you get tough resisting
opponents into double legs down on the floor but not a double leg from in front
but a double leg from behind them much easier to finish because you're going with this sprawl instead of against it
so once again we're in here as long as matthias's knee is off the mat it's very very hard for
me to double leg them it's very hard for me to get behind them and do any kind of useful work so we're going to start by taking our
hands from locked to unlocked i'm going to put my elbow on the floor i have the choice here of cupping his knee that's
always a good choice and then from here i start that action of walking around that puts so much pressure that it
literally forces his knee to the match i put my knee in behind his ankle and from here i go across
and i put him down now from your perspective as the viewer you're not feeling what's happening here
but matthias will tell you you feel so much pressure on your hip
that you're happy to put your knee down on the floor just to relieve pressure
if if the other guy keeps his knee off the mat it's it's just it's a very very unpleasant
experience and mechanically your knee just goes to the mat there's this i don't know anyone who's strong enough to
stop that from happening so once again we're in here and we lock up now from
this position look how we just lean into our opponent every time i step his knee comes up
knee up look how this action of backstepping puts his knee around the floor and then
i just walk and walk and we're in a good position now to go across and put them down from the
other side the mechanical trick of putting
that knee on the floor if i just stay down here and pull i'll never put the knee to the mat it's going to be hell
okay but by punching through and gripping or putting my hands on the floor
in this situation i start that sweeping action he tries to keep his knee off the man make a strong body material still be
polite now strong body strong strong strong now from here this that turn
makes it so difficult for him to stop it then the knee solidifies it
and we drop them straight down to the mat this is our favorite method of getting
that knee to the floor remember you'll need to get knee to the mat if you're gonna switch to the other leg
and complete the double leg from behind that's your goal put pressure on the hip through the
mechanical apparatus we've described which involves going from locked hands to open hands
either cupping the knee or two hands on the floor taking your knees off the mat and then walking with one hip higher
than the other until you can put your knee behind his ankle and switch your double leg from behind
that will put his knee on the mat and that will give you a double leg to work with
okay we're looking at this idea of getting out of a punishing side pin courtesy of an underhook if we can get
the underhook we can get rid of chest to chest contact we can move his head to the same side of his hip so we can come up to our knees once we get to our knees
our first option is the single leg why do i value it so much because you started in a bottom pin a position of
complete disadvantage and you got up and you put the other guy down and you got on top that's a clear expression to your
opponent and to the audience if you're fighting professionally that a full reversal has occurred and the match has
literally changed its course okay that's a significant development in your fighting skill if you can turn a match
around that's devastating to your opponent's confidence and it's fantastic for your own confidence so i put a high
stock on the idea of coming up from the bottom position and with authority putting your opponent down into bottom
position always love that as a move and i'm showing you the mechanical apparatus you need to get it done
now let's start putting things together i've shown you a lot of techniques and it's easy to get rattled by
the sheer number of details that we've been over so let's start putting things together here how we're going to work from bottom position get up to the
single leg and put that guy down with some authority so we've got mattias on top of us we
know that the path here is the underhook okay let's go back a step into this now getting to an underhook never easy on a
good guy one of the best ways one of my favorite techniques is whenever someone goes into a pen i just put my hands on
my chest so that even as he comes into the pin i'm going to get my opportunity to go through into the underhook
position just like so okay now from here with my hands in place i have an ability
to move his body through my underhook but that's going to require the use of my legs so we use our asymmetrical
bridging technique where one foot is flat and the other foot points out in the opposite direction and as a result
we can move matthias from situation where my head is underneath his chest he no longer has the chest chest pin that
he favors now i hold one handed and from here we come up and we've got that grip either hands down on the floor or
coupling our training partner's knee we use that asymmetrical position where i walk around i get his knee to the mat
and as a result i can get my knee behind his ankle and i can either get the ankle here or go across to the knee then from
here we drive in the same direction he's facing and always in these situations we finish by running across to the opposite
side of our uh head and ending up in a side pin so there's a sense in which the
beauty of this move is if it's done well you trade bottom side pin
the top side pin that's one one that's one hell of a tray so let's have a look at that again
here we are my opponent comes in across my side and look how i form a pre-emptive frame where
everything goes in just like so okay now from this position we move our opponent and go in on the legs from this position we're taking our knees off the mat we're putting that pressure on it getting his knee to the floor and as a result i can catch that second leg now from this position my head is on one side and i walk across to the other side tries to put me back in guard with now traded position he was pinning me and now i'm pinning him that's always the big goal we're looking for with these single leg escapes out of bottom side control.
